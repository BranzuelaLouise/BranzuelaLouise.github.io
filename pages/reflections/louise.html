            <p>There is a vast range of ethics between good and evil in cybercrime and cyber security. On one end of the spectrum, there are malicious and evil hackers with greed as their primary motivator, but on the other end, there are morally good hackers whose genuine aspiration to make the today's technological society much more secure for everyone. However, there are also hackers who are in between the two ends of the spectrum who are much more difficult to categorise in terms of ethics. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="referenceText">
            <p>The many groups of evil hackers or black hat hackers that hack for monetary gain, private information or just hacking for the thrill of doing it. These hackers are unethical as they are unconcerned about the damage that their malicious attacks cause on innocent people. Their motivation to hack and search for vulnerabilities within a system are only for personal gain and malicious intent, they have no interest in working for the betterment of society. These hackers are not only morally in the wrong, but also illegal in what they do. The other kind of hackers are the ones that want to do good and advance the field of cyber security to combat against the various ways malicious hackers could attack innocent people. The good hackers or the white hat hackers has the responsibility of finding vulnerabilities in popular and widely used systems before other more malicious hackers can exploit that opening so that normal people can be safe. The white hat hackers are the opposite of the black hat hackers in terms of morality. </p>

            <div class="referenceText">
            <p>Another area where ethics can be debated in cybercrime would be the existence of red hat hackers. A red hat hacker would be the vigilante equivalent of the white hat hacker where their only goal is to eliminate black hat hackers using more aggressive methods than what a white hat hacker might use. If a red hat hacker discovers a black hat hacker, they will use any means necessary to attack the black hat hacker even if those methods are extreme and highly illegal. In today’s society, it is quite ambiguous whether the result justifies the methods of achieving those results. This is quite relevant to red hat hackers as I personally believe that disarming or stopping a black hat hacker from hacking any further is morally a good thing, however, the methods of which they use are morally dubious. Vigilantes like the red hat hacker seek to fulfill their own conception of justice, which is basically self-righteousness, however, their self-righteousness will sometimes align with the general public’s idea of justice. I believe that depending on the circumstances, the red hat hacker’s vigilantism can be ethically permissible, or morally unjustifiable. </p>

            <div class="referenceText">
            <p>I personally believe that ethics in cyber security is a difficult notion to grasp. Whether or not a hacker is ethical is determined by society’s overall moral compass. If society deems their actions as morally justifiable, then I personally would judge their actions as ethical. However, these ethical actions do not always conform with the legal system as sometimes the opinions of the masses conflict with that of the law. </p>
