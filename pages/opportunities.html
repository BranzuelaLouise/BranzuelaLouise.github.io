                <b>Cyber Awareness for Employees </b>
                <p>Often, the easiest way to gain access to an organisation’s sensitive data is not through technical means, but instead through human error <a href="references.html#tessian">(Tessian, n. d.)</a>. According to research, a staggering 88% of all data breaches are caused by human error. This can include things like clicking attachments in phishing emails, plugging compromised USB sticks into company computers or even granting malicious actors' access to premises. Fortunately, the damage caused through this attack vector can be mitigated by implementing an effective cyber awareness training plan for employees. One provider of such training states that their clients experience a 50% reduction in risk of phishing attacks, as well as a host of other benefits <a href="references.html#brink">(Brink, 2016)</a>.</p>

                <b>International and Multi-Agency Cooperation </b>
                <p>Cyber crime continues to pose a complex challenge for law enforcement. The nature of these crimes make it extremely difficult for the perpetrators to be caught and brought to justice. Offenders will often target international victims, where law enforcement have no jurisdiction and are powerless to respond <a href="references.html#grimes">(Grimes, 2016)</a>. In an effort to make prosecution of cyber criminals simpler, nations and agencies have begun to cooperate closely to extend jurisdictions and share resources. In March 2018, the leader of a cyber crime syndicate who had targeted over 100 financial institutions and caused over 1 billion euros in damage was arrested in Spain. The investigation which lasted several years saw the involvement of the FBI, law enforcement from Spain, Romania, Moldova, Belarus and Taiwan, and a number of private cybersecurity firms <a href="references.html#peters">(Peters & Jordan, 2020)</a>. It is unlikely that any one agency acting alone would have been able to put together sufficient evidence to bring down this criminal organisation. </p>

                <b>Business Innovation</b>
                <p>While many industries are driven by a need for greater efficiency and increased productivity, the cyber security industry makes it’s greatest strides in the wake of major disruptions. The Wannacry ransomware attack of 2017 caused massive disruption to computer systems in over 150 countries, including a third of UK National Health Service hospitals. Ambulances were rerouted, compromising patients who were in need of care, and it is estimated that it cost the NHS alone over 92 million pounds <a href="references.html#kaspersky">(Kaspersky, n. d.)</a>. It was the first time a ransomware attack of this magnitude had occurred and it was only possible because users were running outdated, unsupported versions of Windows. The attack prompted Microsoft to release several patches for Windows XP to mitigate potential further damage <a href="references.html#cnet">(CNET, 2017)</a>. It also generated awareness around security best-practices, with many vendors releasing information on how to protect your systems from future ransomware attacks. </p>
