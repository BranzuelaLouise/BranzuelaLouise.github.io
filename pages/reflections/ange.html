            <p>Cybercrimes and cyber security are a wide range of good and evil. There are the plain evil hackers who attack for malicious and greedy intent but there are many other types of hackers that are a lot harder to put in a specific category for ethics. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="referenceText">
            <p>There are many groups of hackers that hack for money, information, or power. These hackers are on the evil side of ethics as they have no regard to what their unwanted attacks cause. These attacks often end up with the victim having to either give up a lot of money as a ransom for the hacker group to leave them alone or they try to ruin someone by either stealing personal information and using as black mail or selling that personal information to someone who has malicious intent. These attacks are not only morally wrong and evil but also illegal. The laws for cybercrimes are a lot newer than the other laws and because of such are a lot less specific and stern on what exactly a cybercrime is, because of this there is a big grey area on the ethics on hacking. One of the biggest moral arguments are whether hackers that hack a company and tell the company that ill fix this problem so that you will not get hacked again for money. On one hand people believe it is wrong because they are in a sense blackmailing them and are still illegally breaking into their network infrastructures. But many people argue that they are good because they are in the end helping the “victim”.  </p>

            <p>An example of an ethically confusing cybercrime is Stuxnet, a hack that destroyed Iran's nuclear weapons. At first you would think how it is confusing, it’s obviously wrong since they hacked and destroyed government property. The hacking was tool was only intended to derail and stop Iran's nuclear program by the U.S government and Israeli governments, because of fear that a big would erupt and Israel would use nuclear weapons on their enemies (Josh fruhlinger,2017). After all the information this hack becomes even more ethically confusing because they did wrong by hacking and stopping Israel but also may have stopped a future world war or at least war in the middle east from happening. This hacking tool did also backfire because it was intended to be used only for this one operation but ended up being modified by other hackers and using it water plant treatments and was use for evil.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="referenceText">
            <p>I personally think that in that specific scenario that the hack was ethically good because it prevented a lot of future problems from a nation that was constantly at war with neighbouring countries, but it backfired, and people ended up using it for wrong reasons. The hacks against business and people for malicious intent are clearly and wrong but the hackers that hack business and ask the business to pay and they will fix the hack are a bit more difficult, but I believe it is more ethically correct then wrong. With the power that cybercrimes we always need to make sure to stay safe and make sure that if we ever do anything online to think about the consequences and if it is morally right to do such.   </p>
