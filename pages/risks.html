                <p>There are many imposing risks and dangers regarding cyber-crimes and large-scale intrusions such as possible data leaks, shutdowns of massive companies and massive loss of money. Large scale intrusions have become a lot more common nowadays such as eBay, adobe and Yahoo. </p>

                <b>Large-Scale Intrusions</b>
                <p>These large-scale intrusions have not only affected the companies that were targeted but also the people that use these pieces of software. When yahoo was hacked in 2013 1 billion accounts were affected and had their names, date of birth, email addresses, passwords and security questions and answers compromised and leaked.  We later found out that it was in fact 3 billion accounts that were impacted and cost the company $350 million. This was one of the biggest data leaks of the 21st century and caused many people to be a lot more aware of the impacts and risks of large-scale intrusions. These large-scale intrusions affect millions of people and cause a lot of day-to-day stress to the average person who uses or used the software from the companies that has been breached. You feel a lot more scared because all your personal information has been stolen, important details about yourself that are probably going to be sold to shady and dangerous people on the dark-web. </p>

                <b>Company Shutdowns</b>
                <p>Another great risk of cyber-crimes is that the company's shutdown or specifically shut-down the software/program that was affected. An example of this was the colonial pipeline shut down that happened very recently, a group of hackers called the DarkSide hackers took ransom of colonial pipeline’s computer systems and refused to turn it back on until they were paid the amount they asked for. This majorly affected colonial pipeline which was responsible for 45% of the gasoline in the east of America and the people of America who must buy fuel.  The gas prices rocketed to crazy high prices that haven’t been seen in a while. The risk and inconveniences this attack bring affect a wide margin of people and business that rely on gasoline. It may seem like a small inconvenience compared to the other major large-scale intrusions, but this weekend long shutdown means that the lines to the gas stations are going to be incredibly long causing people to be more stressed and waste 45 minutes to hours of their time for something as crucial as gas.</p>
