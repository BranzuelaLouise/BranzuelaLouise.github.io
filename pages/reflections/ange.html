            <p>Cyber security is a particularly interesting field when it comes to ethics. I think it is safe to say that malicious actors breaking into computer systems with intent to steal, damage and disrupt in the name of personal gain is an unethical act. However, there are other cases where the lines are blurred and it is not easy to say who is right or wrong, and if their actions are ethical or unethical. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="referenceText">
            <p>Hacktivist groups are one example where ethics can become a grey area. Through the use of computer systems, hacktivists will disrupt and destroy in order to further their political and social agendas, or as a means of retaliation against victims who may otherwise have no way to defend themselves. Whether these actions can be considered ethical or not will depend on an individual's stance on the issue being fought for. In 2012, the U.S. government condemned the political whistleblowing site Wikileaks and pressured payment services such as PayPal and Visa into withdrawing their services from the whistleblowers. As a response, the hacktivist group Anonymous conducted a series of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks against these financial giants, disrupting their services and causing massive losses (Trend Micro, 2017).</p>

            <p>Another area where ethics can be debated are where hackers discover and report security vulnerabilities in an organisation’s systems without permission. It’s common for large entities to issue bug bounties, essentially inviting cyber security experts to try to break their systems or discover vulnerabilities with a reward up for grabs. This can be lucrative for someone with the right skills and is considered wholly ethical as it is being carried out with the company’s permission. Other cases are not as simple. Between 2012 and 2014, Dejan Ornig studied the Slovenian police communication system Tetra and found that it contained security vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration, resulting in communications not always being encrypted. Ornig disclosed his findings to law enforcement, but one year later nothing had been done to remedy them. This prompted him to release his findings publicly, resulting in the rapid patching of the Tetra system. For his part, Ornig had his home raided and charges brought against him, ultimately resulting in a suspended sentence of one year and three months in prison (Zero Day Net, 2016). I personally believe he did the right thing as the consequences of an insecure communications system used by Slovenian police, military and intelligence agencies could be massive. However, had he released his information without first bringing it to the attention of authorities privately I would not be able to condone his actions. </p>

            <p>I think it is clear to see that ethics within cyber security is a complicated concept. Whether a person has acted ethically or not will depend on their stance, which may eventually evolve with time and as significant events unfold. I believe that ethical actions do not always equate to legal actions, and vice versa, as has been the case in many examples throughout history. As long as a majority of cyber actors act in good faith, we will be able to navigate this rapidly evolving industry with safety and prosperity. </p>
