                <p>Today, the word “hacker” is often shown in a negative light by the media and being a hacker is the same as being a cyber criminal. However, there are many types of hackers today who have differing motives from the atypical cybercriminal. According to <a href="references.html#shea">Shea (2019)</a>, there are currently 6 stereotypes for hackers and each of them are identified by the colour of their "hat". The colours represent their contrasting ideals, these colours are white, black, grey, red, green, and blue. Although cyber crime is a very prominent and dire issue in our modern day technologically based society, there are still good and ethical choices open for people out there who are proficient at "hacking".</p>

                <b>White Hats</b>
                <p>A white hat hacker is the most ethical kind of hacker that a cybersecurity expert can become. <a href="references.html#pentasecurity">Pentasecurity (n.d.)</a> describes the white hat as a hacker who breaks into protected systems to test the security of the system or conduct vulnerability assessments for a client. Their motives are mostly driven by a genuine aspiration to make the today's technological society much more secure for everyone. Finding vulnerabilities in popular and widely used systems before other more malicious hackers can exploit that opening is their responsibility so that normal people can be safe.</p>

                <b>Black Hats</b>
                <p>A black hat hacker is the complete polar opposite of a white hat hacker. Their motivation to hack and search for vulnerabilities within a system are only for personal gain and malicious intent, they have no interest in working for the betterment of society. A black hat hacker typically profits from breaking into systems or does so simply to fulfill their desire to cause damage.</p>

                <b>Grey Hats</b>
                <p>A grey hat hacker is a fusion of both the white hat hacker and the black hat hacker. Grey hat hackers usually tend to break some rules, but they don't have the malicious intent behind their actions like the black hat hackers. When a grey hat hacker finds a vulnerability in a system, instead of alerting the authorities or the company, they will most likely offer to repair it for a fee – utilizing it as an opportunity to make some financial gain. </p>

                <p>A red hat hacker is the vigilante version of a white hat hacker. Their only motive is to take down black hat hackers through more aggressive means compared to what a white hat hacker might do. If a red hat hacker were to discover a black hat hacker, they would do everything and anything to attack the black hat hacker even if those methods are extreme and sometimes illegal.</p>

They don't necessarily have malicious intent, but they could cause collateral damage to other people by experimenting with malware and other system penetration techniques.</p>

                <p>These blue hat hackers don't care about protecting people from other malicious hackers or hacking into random systems, their only motivation for hacking is to take revenge against a person, employer, institution or government. They use malware and other tools to take their revenge against whoever wronged them. They have no desire in furthering their own proficiency in hacking as they only have the singular goal of taking revenge.</p>

                <p>These blue hat hackers are external security professionals that work outside of the organization. Companies often hire them to test out their new software and search for any security vulnerabilities prior to releasing it. </p>
